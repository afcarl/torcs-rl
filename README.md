## example 1
Just see the state, action, reward of the environment
Simple but important step in RL

## example 2
Make simple actor-critic agent which can predict action
but can't learn from interaction.

## example 3
Make simple DDPG agent. See https://github.com/yanpanlau/DDPG-Keras-Torcs
I have made the code simpler.
